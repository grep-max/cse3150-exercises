# CSE 3140 Lab 1 - Prefix Sums Lab Exercise
In this lab we are building a function non_neg_prefix_sum for checking to see if the prefix sums of an int array of +1 and -1 never go below zero.
We are also building a function non_pos_prefix_sum testing if the prefix sums of an int array of only +1 and -1 ints, never go above 0.

## Instructions:
### 1. Download Files
### 2. Compile and run (David Flores said this sounds professional): 
```
make
```
### 3. Run 
```
./test
```
